# Types of Machine Learning

Explain the differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

## Overview

In this lesson, you'll learn about the three main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. You'll also learn about the differences between these types of learning and when to use each one.

## Exercise

Implement basic supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms using scikit-learn.
