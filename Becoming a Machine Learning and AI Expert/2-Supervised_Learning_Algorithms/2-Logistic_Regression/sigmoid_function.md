# Sigmoid Function

Mathematically, the sigmoid function is defined as:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$

In the context of logistic regression, `x` represents the linear combination of input features and their corresponding weights (coefficients). The sigmoid function takes the output of the linear combination and maps it to a probability value between 0 and 1. In the case of binary classification, this probability value represents the likelihood of a data point belonging to the positive class (class 1).

To be more specific, suppose we have `n` input features `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` and their corresponding coefficients `β_0, β_1, ..., β_n`. The linear combination of the input features can be represented as:

$$
z = β_0 + β_1x_1 + β_2x_2 + ... + β_nx_n
$$

The sigmoid function is then applied to `z` to obtain the probability of the data point belonging to the positive class:

$$
P(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

In a real-world application, such as the loan approval scenario [example.md](./example.md), you would use the logistic regression model to predict the probability of a loan being approved based on the input features (e.g., credit score, income, loan amount, etc.). The sigmoid function helps convert the output of the linear combination of these features into a probability value that can be thresholded to make the final classification decision (e.g., loan approved or not approved).

To incorporate this into a real-world application, you would follow these steps:

1. Collect and preprocess the data: Gather the input features (e.g., credit score, income, loan amount) and preprocess them as needed (e.g., handling missing values, scaling, etc.).

2. Train the logistic regression model: Fit the model to the training data, estimating the coefficients `β_0, β_1, ..., β_n` that maximize the likelihood of observing the given data.

3. Make predictions: For each new data point, compute the linear combination `z` using the input features and the estimated coefficients. Then, apply the sigmoid function to `z` to obtain the probability value `P(y=1|x)`.

4. Threshold the probabilities: Choose an appropriate threshold value (e.g., 0.5) to make the binary classification decision. If `P(y=1|x)` is greater than or equal to the threshold, classify the data point as the positive class (e.g., loan approved). Otherwise, classify it as the negative class (e.g., loan not approved).

5. Evaluate and iterate: Assess the model's performance using relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and iterate on the model if necessary (e.g., feature engineering, tuning hyperparameters).
